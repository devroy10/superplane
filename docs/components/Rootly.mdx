## On Event

The On Event trigger starts a workflow execution when Rootly incident timeline events are created or updated.

### Use Cases

- **Note automation**: Run workflows when investigation notes are added
- **Timeline sync**: Sync incident timeline events to Slack or external systems
- **Annotation tracking**: Track updates to incident annotations
- **Audit logging**: Capture timeline events for compliance or reporting

### Configuration

- **Visibility**: Optional filter by event visibility (internal or external)

### Event Data

Each incident event includes:
- **id**: Event ID
- **event**: Event content
- **event_type**: Event type (incident_event.created or incident_event.updated)
- **kind**: Event kind
- **occurred_at**: When the event occurred
- **created_at**: When the event was created
- **incident**: Incident information

### Webhook Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Rootly webhook endpoint when configured. The endpoint is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.
